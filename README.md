# Order

      The goal of the game is to order numbers, starting with 0,
      from left to right and from top to bottom.
      When a tile is in its place, mark it by clicking on it.
      Use the arrow keys to move tiles.
      When a tile bumps into its neighbor,
      the neighbor's number decreases (LEFT or UP)
      or increases (RIGHT or DOWN).
      Mark the last unmarked cell to see your score.
