# Order

      The goal is to order consecutive numbers, starting with 0, 
      from left to right and from top to bottom, with a low score.
      When a number tile is ordered, mark the tile (tap or click). 
      You may demark a marked tile, but the score increases.     
      With each move (swipe or arrow key), a new number tile 
      appears in a random cell and the score increases. 
      When a tile bumps into its neighbor, the tile disappears, 
      while the neighbor's number increases (UP & RIGHT) 
      or decreases (DOWN & LEFT). 
      Mark the last cell to see your score, the lower the better.
