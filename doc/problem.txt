#html list value changes by key events

After starting the [Order](http://dzenanr.github.io/order/web/) game, change the game level from 1 to 2.
Use the left arrow key, the current value of the list goes from 2 to 1.
How can I avoid this change?

Key arrows (key events) are used in the game to move tiles. A select element (level) is used to change the size of the board. 
When a user changes the level and clicks on the new button, the key events do not affect the level. 
However, if a user changes the level (e.g., from 2 to 1) and then uses a key arrow (e.g., the left arrow key), 
the level changes (from 2 to 1). I want to disable that change.

I used unsuccessfully 

    document.onKeyDown.listen((KeyboardEvent event) {
      levelSelect.disabled = true;
      ...
      levelSelect.disabled = false;
    });

in the Board class in the lib/view/board.dart file.

Answer:

When I use

    querySelector('#canvas').onMouseDown.listen((MouseEvent e) {
      levelSelect.disabled = true;
      ...
      levelSelect.disabled = false;
    });
 
in the Board class in the lib/view/board.dart file,
   
the key events do not affect the select element. It works, but I do not understand this behavior. 

Comment:

The key events do affect the select element. It was not a correct answer.
 
    
#dart2js problem

After using Pub Build - Minified on the pubspec.yaml of the [order](https://github.com/dzenanr/order) game,
the board of the game does not appear in Chrome.

The [boarding](https://github.com/dzenanr/boarding) package uses enums and mixins.

pubspec.yaml:

    name: order

There are no errors in Dart Editor nor Chrome.

Add this line below the index.dart script tag in index.html

<script src="packages/browser/dart.js"></script>
