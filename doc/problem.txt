#dart2js problem

After using Pub Build - Minified on the pubspec.yaml of the [order](https://github.com/dzenanr/order) game,
the board of the game does not appear in Chrome.

The [boarding](https://github.com/dzenanr/boarding) package uses enums and mixins.

pubspec.yaml:

    name: order
    version: 0.2.7
    author: Dzenan Ridjanovic <dzenanr@gmail.com>
    description: An example from boarding.
    homepage: https://github.com/dzenanr/boarding
    environment:
      sdk: '>=1.0.0 <2.0.0'
    documentation: http://goo.gl/kXlDOJ
    dependencies:
      boarding: any
      browser: any
    transformers:
    - $dart2js:
        minify: true
        terse: true
        commandLineOptions: [--enable-enum]

    Loading source assets...
    Building order...
    [Info from Dart2JS]:
    Compiling order|web/index.dart...
    [Info from Dart2JS]:
    Took 0:00:10.139580 to compile order|web/index.dart.
    Built 7 files to "build".

There are no errors in Dart Editor nor Chrome.

Answer by Gunter Zochbauer:

Add this line below the index.dart script tag in index.html

<script src="packages/browser/dart.js"></script>
